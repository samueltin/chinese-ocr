 1. Detect Angle
 2. Text Detection -- ctpn
 3. Text recognition -- crnn

 1. Detect Angle
 angle/predict.py predict return index 4 elements [0, 270, 180, 90]
 found that this model is not working and it is not called

 3. Text recognition -- crnn keras
 model.py crnnRec
 ocr.model predict (as ocr)
   in predict function call basemodel.predict
   basemodel's structure is defined in ocr.model get_model function
   then load weight from ocr/ocr0.2.h5
